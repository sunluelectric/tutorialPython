# tutorialPython

__This tutorial provides tutorial materials for Python as well as a selection of useful and popular toolkit with Python in mathematics, engineering and IT.__

__This tutorial mainly serves as a demonstration library of basic Python programming and some selected functions of the aforementioned toolkit. Hopefully it would become a good cheat sheet reference for using the toolkit, but do notice that it by itself alone cannot be used as the complete alternative to university textbooks.__

_"pylint"_ is used to standardize the code style used in the tutorial. The guidance to standard Python programming protocol is given in [here](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/) by _python.org_.
