# tutorialPython

__tutorialPython provides tutorial materials for the basic Python. A selection of useful and popular toolkit in mathematics, engineering and IT that can run on Python is also presented.__

__The aim of this tutorial is mainly to demonstrate some basic use cases of Python. Some showcases of using the aforementioned toolkit are also given. Hopefully, this tutorial would become a good cheat sheet reference for Python users. Do notice that the tutorial by itself alone cannot be used as the replacement to university textbooks or licensed training.__
